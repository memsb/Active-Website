		<p>As Gymworld have been in business for well over two decades, weâ€™ve built up a huge base of fitness knowledge and experience to help you achieve your fitness goals. We've always believed that the best way to be a fitness retailer is to get involved with the fitness equipment and test as much of it as we can. When a new range comes out, we'll normally request the manufacturer send us a showroom model to test so we get a good idea of what the newest fitness equipment can offer.
We've had some great surprises when testing out fitness equipment like the Reebok Performance Series B5.1 Exercise Bike which was much smoother and well built than we expected. There's also the brilliant Horizon Fitness Oxford II Rower which continues to be a brilliant and pretty much un-challenged, gym-style rowing machine for much less money than gym standard rowers.</p>

		<p>Cardiff AAC traces its origin back to 1882 and to the Royal Oak public house (still existing) on Newport Road, Cardiff near its junction with Broadway. Gladstone was Queen Victoria's Prime Minister and the first Olympic Games of the modern era (1896) were still fourteen years away.

In those days, groups of young men would challenge each other to races. From such a group, Roath (Cardiff) Harriers was formed and adopted the Royal Oak pub as its headquarters. Roath Harriers was the first athletic club in Wales catering solely for Athletics and quickly became successful in competition and active in other areas. Roath Harriers officials organised the first ever Welsh Cross Country Championships on 7th March 1894 with club runners winning both the individual (Hugh Fairlamb) and team championships. The Fairlamb family seems to have been quite a force as, in l896, Hugh's father was the driving force behind the creation of the Welsh Cross Country Association and its first President, a position he held for the next 16 years.</p>
